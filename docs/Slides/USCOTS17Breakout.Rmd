## Background: Introduction to R (Penn State)  

### Structure

- 1 credit (i.e. one 50 min meeting per week; semester length)
- Reading quiz before class each week  
- Group mini-project began in class each week
- Homework set after class each week
- Final project at end of semester

### Students

- 33 students (3 dropped)
- most did have a STAT course of some kind (including AP)
- 19 had never used R (another 12 had used it "a little")
- Half were not (nor planned to) major in statistics or data science

### Thoughts before, during, and after course

- heavy use of `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, and other `tidyverse` packages (little base R)
- terminology (e.g.,  wrangling, glyph-ready, tidy, pipe)
- included topics completely new to Matt (e.g., scraping HTML tables, leaflets)

## Background: Data Computing (Macalester)  



## Tools: Working code 

- Provide students with concise and consistent framework of commands (& templates)
- Students generally start with working code that they can modify
- Scaffold with interactive tools
    - Inspecting data (`View()`)
    - Visualizations (`xyzGraphBuilder()`)
- interactive commands produce working code that students can then analyze and modify

## Tools: RMarkdown

- advocates common template
    - HTML with embedded Rmd
    - promotes reproducible research habits
    - Students began using it in other STAT classes, and faculty **loved** it
- prevents excessive dependence on interactive commands 
- other document types accessible (LaTeX, slides, etc)

## Tools: Other Resources

- RStudio Cheat Sheets
- DataCamp (full access mid-semester)
- Required weekly ask & answer on Piazza >> class stack exchange

## Sample Activities

- Let's work through a few examples that illustrate the sort of things your students can do in a course like this **without** prerequisites...  
- You will need a laptop connected to the Internet with a current web browser installed  
- Feel free to work in small groups

## PSU Final Project

- Reproducible work (i.e. HTML with embedded .Rmd that runs cold)
- Use real data (not loaded from an R package)
- Data wrangling proficiency
- Visualization proficiency
- High quality code, narrative, and overall product


## Movies in the 21st Century

- scrapes HTML table from [www.the-numbers.com](http://www.the-numbers.com/market/2015/top-grossing-movies)
- basic data wrangling operations: `filter()`, `group_by()`, `summarise()`, `mutate()`
- `ggplot()` graphics exploring relationships among ticket sales, genre, year, studio, etc
- utilized faceting in several places to invite visual comparisons between groups (e.g. MPAA rating)

## FIFA World Rankings Analysis 


- investigate trends among confederations and teams over last 10 years
- scrapes HTML table from [FIFA World Ranking Website](http://www.fifa.com/fifa-world-ranking/ranking-table/men/index.html)  
- wrote `while` loop to utilize an index in the URL to scrape monthly data tables 
- `join` operation adds each monthly table to the master
- reshape data from wide to narrow using `gather()`
- basic data wrangling operations: `select()`, `filter()`, `group_by()`, `summarise()`
- `ggplot()` graphics
- submitted HTML document with embedded .Rmd


![](images/FIFATrends.png)

## Stanley Cup Winners


- investigating trends and commonalities among Stanley Cup champions
- submitted both LaTeX & HTML with embedded .Rmd
- CSV data sourced from Kaggle
- constructed list containing data frames for champions from 1970 to 2012
- used a `for` loop to iterate over list then create and store `ggplot()` graphic for each champion in a new list
- used `party::ctree()` to build competing models based on recursive partitioning 
- likelihood-based model comparison

## 2013 FBI Crime Reporting

- loaded data from [FBI website](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2013/crime-in-the-u.s.-2013/tables/table-8/table_8_offenses_known_to_law_enforcement_by_state_by_city_2013.xls/view) 
- basic data wrangling operations: `select()`, `group_by()`, `summarise()`, `mutate()`
- `USMap()` choropleths for comparisons among states

## Vegetarian Restaurant Analysis

- exploring trends among restaurants that advertise vegeterian and vegan fare
- basic data wrangling operations: `select()`, `filter()`, `group_by()`, `summarise()`, `mutate()`
- interactive map (i.e. leaflet) shows locations of such restaurants throughout the U.S.

```{r echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
data <- read.csv("restaurants.csv")

# Student Code
data1<-unique(data) 
data2<-na.omit(data1)

RestaurantMap <-
 leaflet(data2) %>%
 addTiles() %>%
 addCircleMarkers(radius = 2, color = "red") %>%
 setView( lng =-73.935242, lat =40.730610, zoom = 12)  #New York
```

```
# Student Code
data1<-unique(data) 
data2<-na.omit(data1)

RestaurantMap <-
 leaflet(data2) %>%
 addTiles() %>%
 addCircleMarkers(radius = 2, color = "red") %>%
 setView( lng =-73.935242, lat =40.730610, zoom = 12)  #New York

RestaurantMap
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
RestaurantMap
```


## Vegetarian Restaurant Analysis (Static)

![](images/VegeterianRestaurants.png)

- exploring trends among restaurants that advertise vegeterian and vegan fare
- basic data wrangling operations: `select()`, `group_by()`, `summarise()`, `mutate()`
- interactive map (i.e. leaflet) shows locations of such restaurants throughout the U.S.
